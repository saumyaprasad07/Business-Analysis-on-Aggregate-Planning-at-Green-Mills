# üìä Business Analysis on Aggregate Planning at Green Mills

_A data-driven Excel model recommending the optimal aggregate planning strategy to minimize production costs and balance workforce, inventory, and supply chain efficiency for Green Mills over 12 months._

***

## üß† Objective

This project evaluates and compares multiple aggregate production planning strategies for Green Mills. The aim is to minimize total operational costs while ensuring all customer demand is met by optimizing workforce allocation, inventory levels, and supply chain constraints across a one-year planning horizon.

## üîç Methodology / Approach

1. **Data Cleaning:** Validated and formatted production and demand data; checked for missing or outlier values.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Analyzed monthly demand patterns and constraints on workforce and inventory.
3. **Modeling / Visualization:** Built Excel models for major strategies:
   - Chase Demand
   - Level Production
   - Hybrid Strategy
   - Modeled cost and inventory implications for each.
4. **Optimization:** Compared total costs, workforce fluctuations, and inventory levels to identify the optimal strategy.
5. **Insights:** Evaluated the trade-offs between workforce stability and cost minimization.
