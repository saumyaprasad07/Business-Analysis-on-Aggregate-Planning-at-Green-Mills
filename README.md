# üìä Business Analysis on Aggregate Planning at Green Mills

_A data-driven Excel-based model designed to recommend the optimal aggregate production planning strategy for Green Mills Inc. This project minimizes production costs while balancing workforce utilization, inventory levels, and supply chain efficiency across a 12-month planning period._

***

## üß† Objective

To analyze and compare multiple aggregate production planning strategies‚ÄîChase, Level, and Hybrid (Optimal)‚Äîto identify the most cost-effective plan that meets demand while maintaining operational efficiency and workforce stability.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source:** Internal manufacturing and demand records of Green Mills (see `project_file.xlsx`)
- **Size:** 12 rows (months) √ó several columns (demand, workforce, inventory, costs, etc.)
- **Description:**  
  - *Key columns:*  
    - Month
    - Forecasted Demand
    - Starting Workforce
    - Inventory Level
    - Production Cost
    - Holding Cost
    - Hiring/Firing Costs
    - Overtime/Shifts Used

## üîç Methodology / Approach

1. **Data Cleaning:** Validated and formatted production and demand data; checked for missing or outlier values.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Analyzed monthly demand patterns and constraints on workforce and inventory.
3. **Modeling / Visualization:** Built Excel models for major strategies:
   - Chase Demand
   - Level Production
   - Hybrid Strategy
   - Modeled cost and inventory implications for each.
4. **Optimization:** Compared total costs, workforce fluctuations, and inventory levels to identify the optimal strategy.
5. **Insights:** Evaluated the trade-offs between workforce stability and cost minimization.
