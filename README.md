# Business Analysis on Aggregate Planning at Green Mills

This project analyzes *aggregate planning strategies* for Green Mills, with the goal of reducing production costs and optimizing resource allocation using **Excel-based modeling**. The analysis recommends the optimal strategy by aligning workforce, inventory, and supply chain constraints to efficiently meet customer demand over a 12-month period.

## Project Overview

Green Mills faces variable monthly demand and must determine the best approach to manage production, workforce levels, inventory, and supply chain costs. This project evaluates multiple aggregate planning strategies and quantitatively compares their effectiveness.

## Key Features

- **Excel Models:** Built detailed spreadsheets to simulate production plans, cost trade-offs, and operational constraints.
- **Strategy Comparison:** Analyzed several planning approaches including Chase Strategy, Level Production, and Hybrid Methods.
- **Recommendations:** Proposed the most cost-effective strategy to minimize total expenses while meeting all demand and resource constraints.
- **Presentation:** Includes a PowerPoint summarizing methodology, findings, and strategy recommendations.

## File Structure

- `README.md` – Project summary and instructions.
- `project_file.xlsx` – Main Excel file for data modeling and analysis.
- `green_mills.pptx` – Presentation of findings and recommended strategy.

## How to Use

1. Open `project_file.xlsx` in Excel.
2. Review monthly demand, resource data, and planning models.
3. Compare strategy outcomes based on cost, workforce stability, and inventory levels.
4. View `green_mills.pptx` for a summary and detailed recommendations.
